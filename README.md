# JavaScript Notes by Roman Akmal

🧠 This repository is a **personal learning journal** where I’m documenting everything I’ve learned while studying JavaScript — from fundamentals to advanced topics.  
It contains all **my practice code**, notes, and section-wise folders based on key JavaScript concepts.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each folder represents a topic or section I’ve covered:

- `01-Fundamentals-Part-1`
- `02-Fundamentals-Part-2`
- `03-Developer-Skills`
- ...
- `10-Functions` _(currently working here)_
- ...
- `18-forkify`

## 🧩 What's Inside?

Each section includes:

- 📝 **Code snippets** and practice exercises
- 💡 **Concepts I've learned**
- ✅ Real code written and tested by me
- 🔁 Project files for hands-on learning

## 🚀 Why I'm Doing This

I'm using GitHub to:

- Keep my learning organized and version-controlled
- Track my progress publicly
- Share my growth with potential collaborators, mentors, and recruiters

## 📌 Notes & Usage

This is **not a course repo** — it’s my **own learning repo**. Some project structures or filenames may be inspired by popular tutorials, but all the code is written and practiced by me while understanding the concepts deeply.
